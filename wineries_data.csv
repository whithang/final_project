Picking, fermentation and barrel ageing are done by keeping all clones and blocks separate. By this madness, we are able to learn and appreciate each wine's nuances and style intimately. Our bottlings are determined by the wine's individuality, our largest bottling is 330 cases and the smallest is 23 cases. Picking, racking, and bottling are scheduled as close to the night of the full moon as possible. We have found that she (Adrian Fog) likes and enjoys the effects of the lunar cycle.

Although the vineyard has long since replaced the dairy, the members of the family still operate businesses that the Bonneaus started.In 1988 their daughter, Yvonne, fulfilled Catherine's vision of having a vineyard. She planted 30 acres of Chardonnay grapes on premium rootstock. Yvonne, as matriarch of the family farm, began supplying some of the best known wineries in Sonoma and Napa. The vineyard consistently received high praise for the quality of the fruit. Yvonne looked forward to the day the family could produce their own wines.In 2001, her son, John Bambury, began spearheading the wine making operations on behalf of Yvonne's four children by introducing Bonneau Wines with the 2002 Los Carneros, Chardonnay. Since then Bonneau Wines has produced Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. The family's commitment to making fine wines has already been recognized by wine aficionados, critics and everyday wine lovers alike.  Open daily, closes late at 5pm Monday thru Friday. "

I felt the only way to accomplish this was to fully immerse myself in this endeavor. I would only pursue this goal if I could plant the vineyard, live with the vines and make the wine myself.That meant initially spending years in enology school and learning from those who were already successful. After many years of visiting wine regions and tasting wines from around the world, our adventure truly began in 2001 when my family and I left the East coast for Fresno, California where I attended Fresno State’s top Viticulture and Enology school. As a capstone to my three year program, I worked in Bordeaux for the 2003 harvest with Dr. Alain Raynaud at Chateau Quinault l’Enclos. My stated goal in Bordeaux was to go beyond being a cellar worker and closely examine every facet of Bordeaux vineyards and winemaking. Working with Dr. Raynaud was both a revelation and an inspiration.The journey to Calluna has taken me around the world and led my family to this hilltop in the middle of Sonoma County.

Launched in 2009, we make small lots of Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Syrah and Chardonnay. Our home vineyard is located in the Sonoma Coast appellation, at the top of Sonoma Mountain. This area of the Sonoma Coast is known as the Petaluma Gap, noteworthy for the wind and fog that blows in through a gap in the costal hills. These conditions create the distinct environment needed to grow world-class Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In addition, we source fruit from the top of Bradford Mountain in the Dry Creek Valley appellation. At 1200 feet of elevation, this organically grown vineyard produces Zinfandel and Syrah with distinct mountain-grown characteristics. We choose our locations for growing and sourcing fruit based on a number of factors. Our name speaks to one that we consider essential – fog. We believe that mountain fruit grown above the fog line creates more balanced, focused wines. The additional exposure to sun throughout the growing season enables the vines to get an earlier start in the morning. Additionally, temperature inversion results in warmer nights and cooler days than vineyards at lower elevations. This allows the fruit to ripen both physiologically (getting the sugar to the right level) and phenologically (reaching the point where it tastes fantastic), while lessening the need to leave the fruit hanging for extended periods.

The Zellerbachs planted 6 acres in 1953 (now the oldest Pinot Noir vineyard in America) and created the first vintage in 1957. They named their winery Hanzell, a contraction of Mrs. Hana Zellerbach's name, and embarked on what would become recognized as one of California's most enduring and historically important wine estates. The Zellerbachs' achievement passed to the Day family in 1965 and then in 1975 the de Brye family acquired the estate. Alexander de Brye has presided over Hanzell for the longest period of Hanzell's considerable history and with his patronage the historical property and deep traditions of Hanzell have been honored, protected and promoted. The original 6 acre vineyard has grown to 46 acres today, allowing Hanzell to produce 5,000 cases annually: three-quarters Chardonnay and one-quarter Pinot Noir. Through five decades Hanzell has pursued empirical winemaking and established traditions on which great cellar-worthy winemaking is predicated.

I focus on the wines that I personally love best - Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Moscato Azul (our dry Muscat Canelli). Our flagship wine is our Cabernet Sauvignon, which is a beauty indeed. I have become famous for making this variety during a 30 year career making such wines as Screaming Eagle, Dalla Valle, Grace Family, and so many more. My philosophy is to make the best wines possible by blending modern technology with traditional winemaking. These are wines of high pedigree that are ultimately handcrafted - a magical blend of art and science. Simply put - an incredibly delicious bottle of wine. All the wines are finely balanced, flavorful, pure and elegant. At the end of the day, if I don’t love it, I don’t bottle it, and the results are in the glass!  Located at the Cellars of Sonoma."

We specialize in a luxurious and uniquely intimate experience — with welcoming people and wines. Our limited-production wine is artfully handcrafted to seduce your senses and raise your eyebrows—whether you’re a connoisseur or just a little wine curious. Each sip will leave its mark on you.WHY THE THUMBPRINT?thumbprint cellars began as a hobby for Scott Lindstrom-Dake, owner/winemaker, while studying art in college. A Sonoma County native, he had developed a taste for great wine, but couldn’t afford much of his own. So he began making it in his garage – mostly to impress his future wife, Erica. One night, while preparing for a party, he began gift signing bottles for the guests. When doing so, his pen broke and spilled ink everywhere. As Scott hurried to capture the ink as it ran down the bottle, an inadvertent upsweep of his thumb created a gold thumbprint on one of the bottles. Ever the curious artist, he began dipping his thumb in the ink and placing thumbprints on each bottle he planned to bring to the party. That night, people kept asking for the ""wine with the thumbprint on it."" The thumbprint brand was born — and has continued growing ever since.THE WINE:At thumbprint cellars, we source our wine grapes from local growers throughout Sonoma County. Our grapes come from Dry Creek Valley, Alexander Valley, Russian River Valley and Knights Valley. Scott enjoys making single vineyard designate wines. Think of these wines as a ""snapshot"" of each vineyard and vintage, telling a story about that special place and time. Scott crafts 18 single vineyard varietals, along with 4 infamous blends. With 22 different varietals offered, we make a wine for everyone! Total case production is less then 5,000 cases and our largest production is 350 cases. You can taste the care and craftsmanship in every bottle. THE TASTING LOUNGE: The tasting lounge in Healdsburg features a warm, welcoming, and family-friendly experience offering exciting tastings and an inclusive vibe. Our tasting lounge and our winery host a variety of events each year — including blending workshops, private tastings and winemaker dinners. Wine Club members receive special pricing on all events, wine and retail purchases – plus lots of other perks. We love our Wine Club members and do our best to show it!THE ART GALLERY:The tasting lounge is also an art gallery, proudly showcasing the work of Sonoma County artists. At heart, Scott is an artist. Unlike many scientific-minded winemakers, Scott views winemaking as a form of art—taking raw ingredients and creating a magical multisensory experience. It’s that artistic bent that leads him to experiment with unique varietals and interesting blends — all part of an ongoing attempt to create a masterpiece.  Open daily."

We grow approximately half the grapes we use and purchase the remainder, primarily from small, unique vineyards.The estate vineyards consist of 21 acres, 8 of which are 85 to 117 years old. There are 24 different varieties in the old vineyard, with the most common being Zinfandel, Carignan, Alicante Bouschet, Grenache and Syrah. In addition, there are 10 acres of eleven to sixteen year old vines that consist of Merlot, Chardonnay, Marsanne, and Syrah. We grow more Merlot than anything else. Three more acres were replanted in 2001, predominantly to Syrah, Zinfandel and Grenache.In the vineyard we practice sustainable agriculture. We use a blend of organic and traditional farming practices that promote healthy vines and a healthy environment. Our new, irrigated vineyard blocks have permanent cover crops in order to help replenish the soil and to provide habitat for beneficial insects and spiders. The old, dry-farmed blocks are still cultivated, in order to retain soil moisture. Sulfur dust, used for millennia to control powdery mildew, is the only thing that we ever put on the vines; fortunately we never need insecticides. Winemaking is custom tailored to each small lot of grapes (typical lot size is less than four tons). There are no standard practices other than utilization of the utmost care in handling grapes and wine. All wines are aged in small oak barrels, clarified by racking and are bottled either unfiltered or with minimal filtration. Our oak is currently 90% French, 10% American.  Open daily."
